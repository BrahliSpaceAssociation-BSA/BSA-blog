# Brahollo-1

Brahollo-1 will be a mission from the BSA to launch a satellite into space. The primary goal of that satellite is to facilitate 2 way communication from Earth to Space. Its secondary goal is to take multi-camera images and send a rendered panorama suitable for viewing in VR back to the Earth base station.

## BSA

The BrahliSpace Association - BSA - is an association of individuals who want to push the boundaries of the exploration of Space. The association's members volunteer their free time to further their knowlege by executing on previously agreed upon missions.

## Preface - BSA's Long Term Plans

The long term strategic goal of the BSA is to create a network of satellites that can be used for unobstructed communication with any part of the world. Possesing such a communication network that would be inedpendent from all other actors is of utmost strategic importance for any power, and Croatia, much like the European Union, is no exception. Our long term vision is thus to provide a satelite constellation that would allow such communication. 

As a stepping stone to such a future, a launch of a very small satelite (so called picosat) to the lower Earth Orbit is planned. The goals of this document are to asses and analyze some of the requirements for the project to succeed - namely the technical part of launching said satellite to space (i.e. rocket science), satellite construction (i.e. engineering) and finally the financial constraints of the project. 

## Rocket Science

The most perilous endevour in a satellite's lifecycle must be the launch. There is a huge amount of propulsion required to launch even the smallest of objects into space. The burning of fuels on the rocket that carries the satellite to space is a wild event, yet it must take place before any object pierces through the atmosphere and into the cold space. The price of each additional gram of the payload dramatically increases the cost of the contraption that moves the objects to the orbit. 

The people who are currently involved with the project are not rocket scientists, so for the time being accomplishing space flight with the knowledge held purely within the Association, is not a feasable short term goal. In the long run, the Association would welcome people skilled in that science and plans to have a facility to launch rockets into space. 

To have those capabilities out right is not (thankfully) a requirement to be in controll of a satellite orbiting the Earth. The state of the art technologies have made their way into commercial companies that offer to put satellites into space. Thanks to the advancements in miniaturization, so-called pico satellites are quickly becoming the norm in education and exploration. They are rougly the size of a can and weigh less than a kilogram in total. 

The company we intend to cooperate with is called InterOrbital Systems (IOS) and they offer a packaged deal consisting of a basic satellite (TubeSat) and the launch of it for a very reasonable price. Such a deal would address two of the defficiencies that the BSA currently has - launch and basic satellite construction. It, therefore, makes sense for BSA to seek out such an outsourcing arrangement with the IOS and to start learning from there.  

## Engineering

TubeSat is a very limited technology that puts a lot of limits on the satellite maker. To start with,it orbits the Earth in the low-Earth orbit, from which it falls and burns out completely in the planet's atmosphere three to five weeks after launch date. A round trip takes around 90 minutes, but the radio it is equiped with allows for communication with a stationary Earth station for only 13 of those minutes. Additionally, the bandwidth which is available for data transfer is severly limited. 

Then there is the harsh environment in which the satellite finds itself during normal operation. As it circles around the Earth, the temperature it has to operate it in dramatically changes - from the very warm period when it soaks up the energy coming from the Sun, to the extreme colds that happen in the Earth's shadow. The temperatures aren't the only thing that are extreme, however. The Earth's ionosphere protects life from lethal doses of Solar radiation - which can have adverse effects on most consumer electronics. 

The third big problem is the energy management. Since there are no power outlets one can plug into in Space, electricity generation is a problem that needs to be tackled. The recent advances in solar panels mean that said problem is becoming increasingly easier as the green movement is gaining more traction. The satellite would, obviously, require batteries to store the energy required to ensure consistant power generation, and, optionally, power the satellite as it passes through the shadow realm. 

The bare bones TubeSat configuration offers enough technology to perform the primary mission of the first launched satellite - establishing communication with Earth. The leftoever payload space should be used for an experiment. Currently, the idea is to put multiple cameras on the satellite and attempt to create a coalesced image of space that could be used in VR imigery. 

## Financial Constraints

The budget for the first mission is $10,000, the majority of which will be used on the aquiring the TubeSat and the launch services from IOS (which is going to be $8,000, plus tax). The remainder of the budget is going to be spent on extra hardware for the satellite and software required to efficiently organize the association. The funding comes from the members of the organization. 

## Success of the Brahollo-1 mission

We are going to judge the success of this mission on a reasonably strict scale from 1 to 5, with 2 being already considered a reasonable success.

### 1 - mission failure

The mission will be judged as a failure if any of the following conditions are met:

- the rocket carrying the satellite fails to launch
- the satellite fails to deploy
- the satellite fails to establish communication with the mission control

### 2 - mission accomplishes it's primary goal

The mission will be judged as successful if it accomplishes it's primary goal, which is to serve as a communication relay. 

- the satellite has been deployed and working for at least 168 hours
- the messaging functionality of the satellite has been tested successfully

### 3 - mission accomplishes some stretch goals

First order improvement of the success level 2 would be to achieve all of the following, in addition to all the requirements of the previous success level:

- the satellite takes an image of it's surroundings
- the satellite transfers the image to Earth

### 4 - mission accomplishes all stretch goals

Second order improvement on the success would be to achieve all of the stretch goals initially laid out. That would mean that the satellite is capable of:

- taking mulitple images with multiple cameras
- coallescing them into one large panorama suitable for rendering in VR
- transmitting said panorama back to mission control

### 5 - mission redifines expectations

The mission would get a grade of 5 if it exceeds expectations. This can happen in a multitude of different ways, most of which are hard to predict in advance. However, there are certain conditions that would render this mission a much larger success than initially planned:

- the satellite doesn't burn out in the atmosphere as quickly as it's expected (i.e. stays operational for a much longer time than expected)
- the satellite get's repurposed and completely reprogrammed from the mission controll
